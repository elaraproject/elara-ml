# Elara ML

A minimalist, very lightweight library for machine learning in Rust.

## Goals

- Minimalist (very few dependencies, small codebase)
- Fast and safe (w/ Rust)
- Easy to use API
- Work well within the Elara project

## Future goals

- Python API

## Non-goals

- Support GPU-acceleration (it will remain CPU-only for the foreseeable future)
- Support every use case
- Compete against industry-standard ML frameworks (e.g. Theano, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
